                                    <p>Amongst its scenic beaches and majestic churches, Kanyakumari also boasts of being home to a large memorial that is dedicated to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. This memorial, which was built to honour this eminent personality, is located in the same spot where the urn of the ashes of this renowned individual was kept for the public to pay their homage. After the leader's death, his ashes were divided into 12 different urns and were scattered throughout the country for the general public to pay their last respect to this important figure. Kanyakumari was one of them.Gandhi has close connections with Kanyakumari, and perhaps these associations rendered it necessary to construct a memorial in his memory in this place. Mahatma Gandhi visited Kanyakumari twice in his lifetime, once in 1925 and then later on in 1937. After his tragic assassination in January 1948, when his body was cremated, his ashes were brought to Kanyakumari to be immersed in the Triveni Sea on February 12, 1948. Inside the Gandhi Mandapam, visitors can witness a myriad of photographs of Gandhi, which were taken at different points in his life, and also his pictures with other famous personalities. The responsibility of this memorial was transferred to the administrative control of the Public (Information and Public Relations) Department, from the Public Works Department of Government of Tamil Nadu in the year 1978, and one must say that the memorial is quite well maintained. Located close to the Kumari Amman Temple, the Gandhi Memorial is a must visit tourist spot in Kanyakumari, and is especially loved by patriots and followers of the Gandhian philosophy.It is 42km from Kanyakumari.</p>

                                    <p>Our Lady of Ransom Church is a famous Catholic Church that is located in the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu and was built in dedication to Mother Mary. A brilliant example of Gothic architecture, the church was built during the 15th century and looks breathtakingly beautiful against the blue lashing waves of the ocean behind it. The gold cross on the central tower of the church further adds beauty and charm to this magnificent structure, and its beauty and tranquillity are what attract people the most.Our Lady of Ransom is the Patron of the congregation in Spain, which had long ago redeemed the Christians from Muslim invasions in 1218. The people of Kanyakumari combined the name Ransom with Delight and began to call their patron by the name of Alangara Upakara Matha. It is in her honour that this splendid church has been built. The colourfully stained windows of the church throw multi-hued lights inside the main building, and the three white spires of the primary structure rise up to the sky. The church is in its full splendour in evenings and at night, when it gets lit up. What enthrals people the most is the statue of Virgin Mary, clad in a sari, at the altar. And this in itself is reason enough to visit the enchanting Our Lady of Ransom Church.It is 1km from Kanyakumari.</p>

                                    <p>Built by St Francis Xavier in the 1600s, the St. Xavier Church is a famous historical structure of great religious importance that is located in Kottar of Nagercoil. This Roman Catholic, Latin Rite shrine, is dedicated to Mary, who is the Mother of God. The church enjoys great fame and respect, on account of the fact that miracles have been observed to happen here since times immemorial. The spirituality, power and divinity of the church attract people of all faiths from all parts of the world, and it is not uncommon to see even Hindus pouring oil, praying and making vows here. Thousands and thousands of Catholic pilgrims from as far as British India, Ceylon and Malacca visit the annual festival at the St. Xavier church every year in December to seek blessings from the Lord, and it continues to assert its authority as a supreme abode of the Almighty.The builder of this magnificent church, St Francis Xavier, was a dedicated and exceptional priest who belonged to Goa, but frequently visited Kottar in the district of Kanyakumari, since Kottar was a famous commercial centre in those days. He was popularly known as 'Valiya Pandaram' among the masses, and according to historical accounts, he played an instrumental role in preventing the Padagas from invading Travancore. Pleased, the king granted St. Xavier with a plot at Kottar to construct a Catholic Church, on the land which already housed a church. St Francis Xavier then built another church on the same site, adjacent to the existing Church of St. Mary.It is 15 kms from kanyakumari</p>
