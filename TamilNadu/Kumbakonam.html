                                    <p>The temple is unlike other temples and has a great history behind it. One who visits this temple must visit the nearby pond and take a bath in the pond. It is believed that if you get a bath in the pond you will be washed of sins and get sacred. The pond is magnificent and the city is very beautiful and you can find a lot of temples nearby worth visiting.Situated right beside the Mahamaham tank, it is a visual treat for the eyes and mind. Especially the various rivers in the form deities is a specialty. It is always the first temple we visit thanks to its proximity to the hotel. Sadly the temple does not attract much crowd except during Mahamaham festival. It is 1.2 kilometers from kumbakonam.</p>
