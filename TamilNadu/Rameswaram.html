                                    <p>The Ramnathaswamy temple is a must visit for anyone who comes down to Rameswaram. It has four entrances or towers and generally you enter from the West tower.It was build over 1200 years ago, and has a structure with hundreds of pillars, the entire view is breathtaking and peaceful. There are 22 kundas (wells) in which the devotees take bath before they visit the main sanctum of lord Shiva. It is not mandatory but I would suggest you to give it a try, as the experience is divine and calming.The temple inside has several small temples and each deity has their own significance. The temple ceiling has beautiful depictions of incidents from The Ramayana.Mobile phones and shoes are not allowed inside the temple, so leave them in your car before you enter.Also, carry some quick change as they have several options where you can pay for a quicker darshan of the temple without standing in the queue.The temple has some stalls inside where you can buy holy souvenirs and prasad. It is 0.35 kilometers from rameswaram. </p>

                                    <p>Wonderful views on this 2. 3 km bridge which connects Rameshwaram to the mainland. Majestic Indian ocean on one side and Bay of Bengal on the other side. Turquoise blue water on either side. Police do not allow parking for long, so one has to be quick. There is a railway track running parallel to the bridge some 100 m away connecting Rameshwaram to Madurai. Marvellous experience. It is 13 kilometers from rameswaram.</p>
