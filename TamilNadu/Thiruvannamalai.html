                                    <p>Gingee Fort, which is also known by the name of Chenji Fort, is the only ancient fort that still stands in the region of Tamil Nadu. Located in the district of Villupuram, the fort was also referred to as the ‘Troy of the East’ by the British. Reference of the fort is also mentioned in the history as the fort praised by Chatrapati Shivaji himself. He ranked this fort as ‘one of the most impregnable fortress of India’.The real Gingee fort that was built by the Chola Dynasty in the 9th century was relatively smaller than the current fort, which was rebuilt later on in the 13th century. The present form of the fort was attributed to the effort of Shivaji himself. However, the fort is not in proper conditions now but the architectural beauty is still worth seeing. It is 39.4 kilometers from thiruvannamalai.</p>
