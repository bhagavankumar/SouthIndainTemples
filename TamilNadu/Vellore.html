                                    <p>This is both historically and from a religious point of view a very good place to visit. The architecture is simply amazing. I suggest to read up about the temple before the visit to truly appreciate it. There is a tunnel from a nearby fort connecting here thats almost 5 km long. The gopurams here really depict our history. The aarti is really a sight to behold. A must for a person visiting the city. It is 16 kilometers from vellore railway station.</p>
